# 🍔 Flying Food

A front-end web application for online food delivery.
This Single page application was developed during my university internship at Stackhouse SRL. It was entirely built using React and TypeScript, with data retrieved via an API REST and integrated into the app. The site’s performance was optimized through the use of React Hooks. For the design, Styled Components were implemented to create a dynamic and responsive user interface.
