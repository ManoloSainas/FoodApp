Project: Flying Food
A front-end web application for food delivery online.

This Single page application was developed during my university internship at Stackhouse SRL. It was entirely built using React and TypeScript, with data retrieved via an API REST and integrated into the app. The siteâ€™s performance was optimized through the use of React Hooks. For the design, Styled Components were implemented to create a dynamic and responsive user interface.

Additional tools used include Vite, npm, Flexbox, Grid, React Router, Context, Redux, Redux Toolkit, Redux Persist, and React Toastify.

The token for API requests has been disabled by Stackhouse SRL. 
To see how the application works, please refer to the video and the screenshots contained in the folder "Final result - video and screenshots".
