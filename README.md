Title: Flying Food

This project was developed during my university internship at Stackhouse SRL. It was entirely built using React and TypeScript, with data retrieved via an API and integrated into the app. The siteâ€™s performance was optimized through the use of React Hooks. For the design, Styled Components were implemented to create a dynamic and responsive user interface.

Additional tools used include Vite, npm, Flexbox, Grid, React Router, Context, Redux, Redux Toolkit, Redux Persist, and React Toastify.
